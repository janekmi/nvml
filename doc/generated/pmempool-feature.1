.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pmempool\-feature\f[] \- toggle or query pool set features
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ feature\ (\-e|\-d|\-q\ feature\-name)\ [options]\ <file>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool feature\f[] command enables / disables or query pool
set features.
.PP
Available pool \f[I]feature\-names\f[] are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]SINGLEHDR\f[] \- only the first part in each replica contains the
pool part internal metadata.
This value can be used only with \f[B]\-q\f[].
It can not be enabled or disabled.
For details see \f[B]poolset\f[](5).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] \- only the first 2KiB of pool part internal
metadata is checksummed.
It is required to use other features e.g.
\f[B]SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[].
When \f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] is disabled whole 4KiB is checksummed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] \- check if pool consistency was not harmed by
power failure.
It requires \f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] to be enabled since it stores
additional metadata in the second 2KiB of pool part internal metadata.
