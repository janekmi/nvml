\f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[](), \f[B]pmempool_feature_enable\f[](),
\f[B]pmempool_feature_disable\f[]() \- toggle or query pool set features
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include\ <libpmempool.h>

int\ pmempool_feature_query(const\ char\ *path,\ enum\ pmempool_feature\ feature);

int\ pmempool_feature_disable(const\ char\ *path,\ enum\ pmempool_feature\ feature);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]feature\f[] argument accepts following values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SINGLEHDR\f[] \- only the first part in each replica
contains the pool part internal metadata.
This value can be used only with \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[]().
It can not be enabled or disabled.
For details see \f[B]poolset\f[](5).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K\f[] \- only the first 2KiB of pool part
internal metadata is checksummed.
It is required to use other features e.g.
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[].
When \f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K\f[] is disabled whole 4KiB is
checksummed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] \- enables additional check
performed during opening the pool which checks if pool consistency was
not harmed by power failure.
It requires \f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K\f[] to be enabled since it
stores additional metadata in the second 2KiB of pool part internal
metadata.
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K\f[] has to enabled prior to
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] otherwise enabling
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] will fail.
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[]() function checks state of
\f[I]feature\f[] in the pool set pointed by \f[I]path\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool_feature_enable\f[]() function enables \f[I]feature\f[]
in the pool set pointed by \f[I]path\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool_feature_disable\f[]() function disables
\f[I]feature\f[] in the pool set pointed by \f[I]path\f[].
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Pool sets with features not defined in this document (e.g.
enabled by the newer software version) are not supported.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[]() returns 0 if
\f[I]feature\f[] is disabled or 1 if it is enabled.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] accordingly.
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmempool_feature_enable\f[]() returns 0.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] accordingly.
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmempool_feature_disable\f[]() returns 0.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[] accordingly.
