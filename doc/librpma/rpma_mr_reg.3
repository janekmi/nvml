The maximum replicated memory region size can not be bigger than the maximum
locked-in-memory address space limit. See **memlock** in **limits.conf**(5)
for more details.

# CAVEATS #

**librpmem** registers a pool as a single memory region. A Chelsio T4 and T5
hardware can not handle a memory region greater than or equal to 8GB due to
a hardware bug. So *pool_size* value for **rpmem_create**(3) and **rpmem_open**(3)
using this hardware can not be greater than or equal to 8GB.


# TARGET NODE ADDRESS FORMAT #

```
[<user>@]<hostname>[:<port>]
```

The target node address is described by the *hostname* which the client
connects to, with an optional *user* name. The user must be authorized
to authenticate to the remote machine without querying for password/passphrase.
The optional *port* number is used to establish the SSH connection. The default
port number is 22.


+ **RPMA_ENABLE_SOCKETS**=0\|1

Setting this variable to 1 enables using **fi_sockets**(7) provider for
in-band RDMA connection. The *sockets* provider does not support IPv6.
It is required to disable IPv6 system wide if **RPMA_ENABLE_SOCKETS** == 1 and
*target* == localhost (or any other loopback interface address) and
**SSH_CONNECTION** variable (see **ssh**(1) for more details) contains IPv6
address after ssh to loopback interface. By default the *sockets* provider is
disabled.

* **RPMEM_ENABLE_VERBS**=0\|1

Setting this variable to 0 disables using **fi_verbs**(7) provider for
in-band RDMA connection. The *verbs* provider is enabled by default.

* **RPMEM_MAX_NLANES**=*num*

Limit the maximum number of lanes to *num*. See **LANES**, in **rpmem_create**(3), for details.

* **RPMEM_WORK_QUEUE_SIZE**=*size*

Suggest the work queue size. The effective work queue size can be greater than
suggested if **librpmem** requires it or it can be smaller if underlying hardware
does not support the suggested size. The work queue size affects the performance
of communication to the remote node.
**rpmem_flush**(3) operations can be added to the work queue up to the size of
this queue. When work queue is full any subsequent call has to wait till the work
queue will be drained. **rpmem_drain**(3) and **rpmem_persist**(3) among other
things also drain the work queue.
